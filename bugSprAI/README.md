BugSprAI (Bug Spray)
BugSprAI is a soon-to-be bug hunting AI currently being trained on LaCucaracha and testCode. 
In the first iteration, it is a rule-based bug hunter.

It can identify anywhere from critical bugs to trivial bugs, and can be set to either merely alert the user or even fix the code in question; because this is a sensitive area for AI manipulation, a txt file will log all alerts and/or changes made. BugSprAI is intended as a seperate project, which will eventually be independant and potentially accessible via "plain text".
