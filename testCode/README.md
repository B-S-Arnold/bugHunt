This directory supports both laCucaracha and bugSprAI.

For all intents and purposes the code in this directory will be correct although largely unnecessary for the actual execution of the code. The purpose of this code is to be randomly injected by "LaCucaracha" and alternatively inspected, tested, and fixed by "BugSprAI"

The code within this directory may be executed and will have test cases to affirm whether it runs as intended (albeit not necessarily bug free), whether there are bugs, and to throw errors (though not overly specific) when it doesn't run properly and/or fails.
