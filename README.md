# bugHunt
Bug Injector training and Bug Hunter project


Bug Injector
laCucaracha is a randomized "bug injector" which is used exclusively for training "Bug Hunting." It will keep record of the exact location where bugs were injected, and can be undid. However, for the sake of safety, is only recommended for use on "test code."

Bug Hunter
bugSprAI is a bug hunting AI currently being trained on laCucaracha and testCode. It is intended as a seperate project, which will eventually be independant and potentially accessible via "plain text"
